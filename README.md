# DotA-type Inventory and Characteristics

![Demo Video](https://youtu.be/6VOYSzR7_54)

## Overview

This project is a web application that simulates an inventory and
characteristics system inspired by DotA-style games. It features a shop with
multiple sections, a player inventory, and a comprehensive stats table that
reactively tracks various player attributes.

## Features

### **Shop System**

Browse through multiple pages of items, each with unique attributes.

### **Player Inventory**

Manage an inventory that can hold up to six items.

### **Dynamic Stats Table**:

View and track player stats, including:

- Basic stats like Strength or Mana
- Complex stats like Attack Cooldown or Damage per Second.

### **Item Attributes**

Items can provide:

- Flat bonuses (e.g., +20 Strength)
- Percentage bonuses (e.g., +20% Strength)
- Stat multipliers (e.g., x2 Strength)

### **Recipe System**

Some items are recipes that require multiple components to be purchased before
they can be used.

### **Gold Management**

Players start with 1500 gold, can buy items, and sell them for half their cost.

### **Interactive UI**

Hovering over items reveals their name, description, stat bonuses, and gold
cost. Recipe items display their required components.
